<h2 style="text-align: center;">Home&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Tardigrades are also known as water bears or moss piglets. Tardigrades are one of the strongest creatures. They can survive extreme temperatures, radiation, air deprivation, dehydration, starvation, and crazy amounts of high pressure.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">About</h2>
<p>Tardigrades can be anywhere from 1.5 mm and below 0.1 mm with the newly hatched ones smaller than 0.05 mm. The body has three different segments and a head. They have eight stubby legs. Their legs have no joints and the feet have 4-8 claws. To eat they suck fluids from algae, moss, and lichens. Tardigrades can withstand extreme temperatures close to absolute 0, or really hot temperatures close to 300 degrees Fahrenheit. They can withstand pressure six times greater than the bottom of the ocean. They can withstand radiation hundreds of times higher than the lethal dose for humans. They can survive these things by going into the "tun" state which is triggered when conditions become unbearable. It stops their metabolism and reduces their need for oxygen. During the "Tun" state they don't age and their organs are protected by a sugary gel called trehalose.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Habitat</h2>
<p>&nbsp;Tardigrades live normally live in lichens and mosses. They also live in dunes, seasides, leaves, soil, and barnacles. They are normally found in those places but have been found pretty much everywhere else. They've been found anywhere from mountain tops to the bottom of the ocean.&nbsp;</p>
